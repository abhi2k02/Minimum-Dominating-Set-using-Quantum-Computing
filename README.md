Finding the minor dominating set of a graph using the Grover's algorithm in Quantum computing

Finding the minimal dominant set of undirected graphs is one NP-complete problem
that could be addressed with the help of recent developments in quantum computing.
Comparing quantum algorithms to classical methods reveals faster search times, espe-
cially with Groverâ€™s search. This study describes the use of the quantum computing
platform Qiskit to construct a quantum algorithm for the minimal dominant set issue.
The algorithm is currently experimental and produces probabilistic results. According
to a recent research publication, the algorithm has a complexity of $O(1.414^n)$. The
approach is applied dynamically in this work, generating probability histograms for
potential dominating sets from classical graph inputs. Notably, the goal is to develop
a quantum algorithm with a deterministic polynomial time complexity for the lowest
dominant set in interval graphs, which is an advancement over existing conventional al-
gorithms. Utilising quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimisation problems
has advanced with this effort.
